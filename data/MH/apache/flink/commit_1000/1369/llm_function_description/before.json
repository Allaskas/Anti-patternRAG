        "function_description": "The Java code defines an interface called DeserializationSchema, which is responsible for converting byte messages from data sources like Apache Kafka into Java objects that can be processed by Flink. This interface serves as a blueprint for creating custom deserialization logic. It has two main components: the deserialize method, which takes a byte array message and returns the corresponding deserialized object, and the isEndOfStream method, which checks if a given element signals the end of the data stream. The DeserializationSchema interface extends other relevant interfaces, such as Serializable and ResultTypeQueryable, to ensure it can be used in various Flink applications. It is designed to work with Flink's data processing pipeline, allowing users to customize how their data is deserialized from byte messages into usable Java objects. The interface is part of the Apache Flink project and is marked as deprecated, recommending the use of an alternative DeserializationSchema interface instead."

        "function_description": "The Java code is a simple serialization schema for strings, which is used to convert between string and byte representations. It consists of a single class called SimpleStringSchema that extends another class with the same name from a different package. The class has two constructors: one with no parameters that uses the default UTF-8 charset for conversions, and another that takes a charset as a parameter, allowing users to specify their own charset. The class implements two interfaces: SerializationSchema and DeserializationSchema, which define methods for serializing and deserializing strings respectively. However, the actual implementation of these methods is inherited from the superclass. The class is deprecated, meaning it should not be used in new code and may be removed in future versions, and instead, users are advised to use a similar class from a different package. The overall structure of the code is straightforward, with a focus on providing a simple way to serialize and deserialize strings using a specified charset."
