        "function_description": "The provided Java code defines an abstract class called AbstractDeserializationSchema, which serves as a base schema for deserializing byte messages from data sources like Apache Kafka into Java or Scala objects that can be processed by Flink. This class is part of the Flink streaming utility package and provides a way to automatically extract type information from generic class arguments. The main component of this code is the AbstractDeserializationSchema class itself, which extends another abstract deserialization schema and implements the DeserializationSchema interface. Its primary role is to outline how byte messages should be converted into specific data types, making it easier for Flink to process them. However, it's noted that this class has been deprecated in favor of using org.apache.flink.api.common.serialization.AbstractDeserializationSchema instead."

        "function_description": "The Java code defines an interface called DeserializationSchema, which is responsible for converting byte messages from data sources like Apache Kafka into Java objects that can be processed by Flink. This interface has two main components: the deserialize method, which takes a byte array message and returns a deserialized object, and the isEndOfStream method, which determines whether an element signals the end of a stream. The DeserializationSchema interface extends several other interfaces, including Serializable and ResultTypeQueryable, to provide additional functionality. It is also deprecated in favor of another interface, suggesting that it may be replaced or updated in future versions. Overall, the purpose of this interface is to provide a standardized way for Flink to deserialize data from various sources, allowing for flexible and efficient processing of different data types."

        "function_description": "The main functionality of this Java code is to define an interface called ResultTypeQueryable, which serves as a contract for functions and input formats to specify the data type they produce. This interface has one key method, getProducedType, which returns the produced data type as TypeInformation. The purpose of this interface is to provide an alternative to reflection analysis, allowing for more flexibility in situations where the produced data type may vary depending on parameters. The ResultTypeQueryable interface is part of a larger framework and is intended to be implemented by classes that need to inform the framework about their output data types. It plays a crucial role in enabling the framework to understand and work with different data types, promoting better type safety and compatibility."
