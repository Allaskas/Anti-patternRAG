        "function_description": "This Java code defines a serialization and deserialization schema, specifically the TypeInformationSerializationSchema class. The primary function of this class is to transform typed data from and to byte arrays using Flink's serialization stack. It has two main components: a type information object that stores the type being serialized or deserialized, and a serializer object responsible for the actual de-serialization and serialization process. The class implements both DeserializationSchema and SerializationSchema interfaces, providing methods for deserializing byte arrays into typed objects and serializing typed objects into byte arrays. It also includes methods to check for end-of-stream signals and retrieve the produced type information. The schema is designed to work with Flink's execution configuration and type serializer configuration, allowing it to be used in various data processing applications."

        "function_description": "The Java code defines an interface called DeserializationSchema, which is responsible for transforming byte messages from data sources into Java objects that can be processed by Flink. The interface has several key components: the open method for initialization, the deserialize method to convert byte messages into Java objects, and the isEndOfStream method to determine if a message signals the end of a stream. Additionally, it includes an InitializationContext interface that provides contextual information during initialization, such as access to user metrics and class loaders. The DeserializationSchema interface extends Serializable and ResultTypeQueryable, indicating that its instances must be serializable and able to query the produced type. Overall, this interface plays a crucial role in Flink's data processing pipeline by enabling the conversion of raw byte messages into usable Java objects."
