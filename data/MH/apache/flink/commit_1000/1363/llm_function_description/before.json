        "function_description": "The provided Java code defines a class called TypeInformationSerializationSchema, which serves as a serialization and deserialization schema. This class is responsible for transforming typed data to and from byte arrays using Flink's serialization stack. It takes a type information object and an execution configuration as parameters in its constructor, allowing it to handle the de-serialization of a specific data type according to the provided configuration. The class implements both DeserializationSchema and SerializationSchema interfaces, enabling it to perform both serialization and deserialization operations. However, this class is marked as deprecated, indicating that it should not be used for new development and instead, an alternative class called TypeInformationSerializationSchema from the org.apache.flink.api.common.serialization package should be utilized. The overall structure of the code consists of a single class with a constructor, extending another class with the same name from a different package, and implementing two interfaces related to serialization and deserialization."

        "function_description": "The main functionality of this Java code is to define an interface called DeserializationSchema, which is responsible for describing how to convert byte messages from data sources into Java objects that can be processed by Flink. The interface has two primary methods: deserialize and isEndOfStream. The deserialize method takes a byte array message as input and returns the deserialized message as an object, or null if deserialization fails. The isEndOfStream method checks whether a given element signals the end of the stream and determines whether it should be emitted or not. This interface extends other important interfaces such as DeserializationSchema, Serializable, and ResultTypeQueryable, indicating that it must provide type information and adhere to serialization rules. Overall, this code provides a foundation for custom deserialization logic in Flink applications, allowing developers to create their own schemas for converting byte messages into usable Java objects."
