        "function_description": "The provided Java code defines an interface called DeserializationSchema, which is responsible for converting byte messages from data sources like Apache Kafka into Java objects that can be processed by Flink. This interface serves as a blueprint for creating custom deserialization logic. It has several key components: the open method for initialization, the deserialize method to convert byte messages into objects, and the isEndOfStream method to determine if an element signals the end of a stream. The DeserializationSchema also provides access to additional features through its InitializationContext, such as registering user metrics and accessing the user code class loader. This interface plays a crucial role in Flink's data processing pipeline by enabling the conversion of raw data into a format that can be efficiently processed and analyzed."

        "function_description": "The provided Java code defines an interface called ResultTypeQueryable, which serves as a mechanism for functions and input formats to inform the framework about the data type they produce. This interface is crucial when the produced data type may vary based on parametrization, providing an alternative to reflection analysis. It contains a single method, getProducedType, which returns the TypeInformation of the data type produced by the implementing function or input format. The main purpose of this interface is to enable explicit declaration of output types, enhancing flexibility and accuracy in data processing pipelines. It plays a key role in ensuring that the framework has accurate information about the data types being processed, which is essential for efficient and correct execution of data processing tasks."
