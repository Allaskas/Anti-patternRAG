        "function_description": "The main functionality of this Java code is to provide a base class for deserialization schemas, which are used to convert byte messages from data sources into Java objects that can be processed by Apache Flink. The class is part of the Flink streaming utility package and serves as a foundation for creating custom deserialization schemes. It automatically extracts type information from generic class arguments and produces the corresponding Java object type. The class implements the DeserializationSchema interface, which defines the contract for deserializing data, and extends the AbstractDeserializationSchema class from the Flink API common serialization package. Although it is marked as deprecated, its purpose is to provide a standardized way of deserializing data in Flink applications, making it easier to work with various data sources and formats."

        "function_description": "The Java code defines an interface called DeserializationSchema, which plays a crucial role in converting byte messages from data sources like Apache Kafka into Java objects that can be processed by Flink. This interface has two primary responsibilities: deserializing byte messages and determining if a message signals the end of a stream. The deserialization process involves taking a byte array as input and returning a corresponding Java object, with the option to return null if deserialization fails. The isEndOfStream method checks whether a given element indicates the end of the data stream, allowing the system to handle such elements accordingly. The interface also extends other relevant interfaces, including DeserializationSchema from the Flink API and Serializable, ensuring that it provides necessary type information and can be serialized as needed. Overall, this interface serves as a foundation for creating custom deserialization logic in Flink applications, with its functionality being crucial for processing data from various sources."
